# Upgrading Legendary Gems In Diablo Immortal Season 2

All Legendary Gems start out with Rank 1 and can go to a maximum of Rank 10. Upgrade costs depend on two factors: the Star rating of the gem (1, 2, or 5) and the current Rank of the gem in question.

Ranking up Legendary Gems is very expensive, so make sure that you are investing only in your most important gems. Unlike with Legendary Items, you cannot transfer Ranks between Legendary Gems, so choose wisely!

Legendary Gems require two components to upgrade: Gem Power and duplicate copies of the gem you're trying to upgrade. The ranks of the gems you need depend on the Star rating of the gem in question.


### Gem Power

All 1-Star Legendary Gems require increasing amounts of Gem Power at all Ranks to level up to Rank 10; 2-Star and 5-Star Gems require it for ranking up through Rank 4.

Gem Power is rating of any loose (unsocketed) Legendary Gems and

Gem Fragments you have in your Inventory. For example, ranking up a 2-Star Gem from Rank 1 to Rank 2 costs 5 Gem Power, and ranking it from Rank 2 to Rank 3 costs 15 Gem Power:

Clicking the Gem Power button under Required shows you what you have to contribute. You can also use Auto Fill, but that can be risky, particularly if any of the gems you have in your inventory are ones you are saving as duplicate gems for upgrades (see below).

This shows the numeric values of the gems and

Gem Fragments you have to contribute. In this case, you only have a total of 6 Gem Power available, so you're not going to be able to do this upgrade.

Gem Fragments happen in cases where you contribute a Legendary Gem with multiple Gem Power points, but you don't need all of them to complete the upgrade. Whatever is left over is saved as

Gem Fragments. For example, if you upgrading a Rank 1, 1-Star Gem which needs only 1 Gem Power to advance, and you wanted to use your Cutthroat's Grin toward the Gem Power, it will return the excess Gem Power as

Gem Fragments.

This is why you need to be careful about what Legendary Gems you are using for Gem Power. Make sure they're not gems you will want or need later!


### Gem Power and Rank

When you use a Legendary Gem as a source of Gem Power, it starts off with a base amount depending on the Star power of the gem. These are the Gem Power values for a Rank 1 Legendary of the different qualities:

When you use an upranked Legendary Gem for Gem Power, you are recovering the Gem Power that you put into upranking it, plus the base amount for the star quality of the gem. For example, a Rank 4 1-Star Legendary Gem costs 16 Gem Power to take from Rank 1 to Rank 4 (1, 5, 10). Since the base Gem Power value for a 1-Star Gem is 1, the Gem Power value of this Rank 4 gem is 17.

Be warned, however: Gem Power is only good for upranking 1-Star Gems through all levels; it's only used in upranking 2-Star and 5-Star gems through Rank 4.


### Duplicate Gem Copies

For 1-Star Gems, starting at Ranks 5>Rank 6, you will need a Rank 1 copy of the same gem to upgrade it for all ranks through 10. For 2-Star and 5-Star gems, you will need ranked copies of the gem at Ranks 1, 3, and 5, depending on the rankings and star quality.


# Upgrade Costs Per Star Rank

It may not seem worth it to upgrade a 1-Star Legendary Gem to Rank 10. It is, however, the cheapest way to get a Rank 10 Legendary Gem to gain Resonance and Awaken a Legendary gear item, so it can be worth it to earn that perk.

Ranked Copies must be the same Legendary Gem as the one being upgraded. For example, you can only use another

Zod Stone as a duplicate copy to rank up a

Zod Stone, but you can't use a

Zod Stone to upgrade

Freedom and Devotion.


# Upgrading Legendary Gems at the Apprentice Jeweler

To upgrade a Legendary Gem, go to the Apprentice Jeweler and click Manage. Select the slot with the Legendary Gem you wish to upgrade. If you have a socketed Legendary Gem that can be upgraded and you have all the materials ready to go, it will show up with a green arrow.

If you wish to upgrade a loose Legendary Gem (not currently socketed), select the middle tab to show any Legendary Gems in Inventory you can choose to upgrade:

Select the gem you wish to upgrade, (Miscellaneous Item #1063590), and click Upgrade.

It will show you the Upgrade screen, including the effects of the upgrade and what you need to upgrade it. Click on the Gem Power icon to select the source of your Gem Power manually, or click Auto Fill.

Auto Fill will pick any

Gem Fragments or unsocketed Legendary Gems in your inventory to fill out your Gem Power automatically. It doesn't give you a chance to preview what it's using, so it can be a risky move if you're not sure what you have in your inventory. It's much safer to click the Gem Power button and do this manually.

Once you've clicked the Gem Power button, you can see the possible sources of your Gem Power. In this case, there isn't a lot to choose from. When it says Full Power, it's ready for upgrade.
